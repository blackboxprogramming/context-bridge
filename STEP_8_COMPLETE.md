## 💡 Engagement Strategy

### First Hour (Critical)

- ✅ Stay humble, not defensive

### First 24 Hours

- ✅ Check every 2-3 hours
- ✅ Engage with thoughtful responses
- ✅ Address criticisms honestly
- ✅ Share updates in comments

### Common Criticisms (and Responses)

**"Why not just use bookmarks?"**
→ "Fair point! This is for dynamic context that changes frequently."

**"Seems unnecessary"**
→ "You might be right for some workflows! Different strokes for different folks."

**"Privacy concerns"**
→ "Valid. That's why it's open source and client-only. GitHub has full source."

**"Why GitHub?"**
→ "Zero infrastructure needed. Open to PRs for other backends!"
