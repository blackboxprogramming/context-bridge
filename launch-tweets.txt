The problem: You have important context AI needs
- Your role, expertise, preferences
- Current projects & goals
- Communication style
- Recent wins & blockers

But you're tired of copying/pasting it EVERY time.

Context Bridge adds a simple "Insert Context" button.

---

How it works:

1️⃣ Store your context in a GitHub Gist (you own your data)
2️⃣ Configure Context Bridge once with your Gist URL
3️⃣ Visit any supported AI platform
4️⃣ Click "Insert Context" button
5️⃣ Done! Your full context is inserted instantly

No servers. No tracking. Just works.

---

Privacy first:
✅ Your data stays in YOUR Gist
✅ No tracking or analytics
✅ No middleman servers
✅ Open source - audit the code
✅ Direct GitHub connection only

You own your context. Period.

Performance:
⚡ First load: <300ms
