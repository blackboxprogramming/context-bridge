## Option 1: Technical/Developer Focused

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
I just shipped Context Bridge – a browser extension that saves you from copying your context into ChatGPT/Claude/Copilot 100 times a day.

One click. Your context appears. That's it.

Free. Open source. No tracking.

🧵 Here's how it works:

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)
Every AI conversation, same ritual:

"I'm a developer building X"
"I prefer Y style"
"Current project: Z"

Copy. Paste. Repeat.

Your fingers are tired. Your time is wasted.

There had to be a better way.

### Tweet 3 (The Solution)
Context Bridge adds an "Insert Context" button to:
• ChatGPT
• Claude
• GitHub Copilot
• Google Gemini

Click it → Your context appears instantly.

One-time setup. Works forever.

### Tweet 4 (Privacy Angle)
Unlike other tools, your data stays YOURS.

Context lives in your GitHub Gist.
Direct HTTPS connection.
No servers. No tracking. No BS.

We don't even know you exist. 

That's how it should be.

### Tweet 5 (Technical Details)
Built with vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).
30x faster with intelligent caching.
100 automated tests. 0 vulnerabilities.

Chrome (Manifest V3) ✅
Firefox (Manifest V2) ✅

Both versions, one day of work.

### Tweet 6 (Stats/Proof)
Development: 5 sessions (~15 hours)
Tests: 100% pass rate
Performance: 10ms with cache, 300ms without
Size: 24KB (yes, kilobytes)

Proof that you don't need a framework for everything.

### Tweet 7 (Use Cases)
Perfect for:
• Devs with specific coding preferences
• Consultants juggling client contexts
• Writers maintaining style guides

If you use AI daily, you need this.

## Option 3: Story-Driven

### Tweet 1 (Personal Story)
I got tired of copying the same text into ChatGPT 20 times a day.

So I built Context Bridge.

One-click context insertion for ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot & Gemini.

Just launched. Here's the story 🧵

### Tweet 2 (The Pain)
Every morning, same routine:

Open note with my context.
Copy.
Paste into ChatGPT.
Start working.

New chat? Do it again.
Switch to Claude? Do it again.
Need Copilot? Do it again.

I was spending 30+ min/week just copying text.

### Tweet 3 (The Breaking Point)
One day I forgot to include a crucial detail.

AI gave me wrong advice.
Wasted an hour debugging.
All because I didn't copy the full context.

That's when I knew: there has to be a better way.

### Tweet 4 (The Build)
Built Context Bridge in 5 sessions:

Session 1: CLI tool
Session 2: Extension basics
Session 3: All 4 platforms
Session 4: Testing & hardening
Session 5: Scale optimization

100 tests. 0 vulnerabilities. 30x performance boost.

### Tweet 5 (How It Works)
Simple:

1. Store context in GitHub Gist (you own the data)
2. Configure extension once
3. Visit any AI site
4. Click "Insert Context"
5. Done

Your context appears instantly. Every time.

### Tweet 6 (The Privacy Win)
I hate tools that collect my data.

So Context Bridge:
- Connects directly to YOUR Gist
- No servers (no middleman)
- No tracking
- No analytics
- Open source (audit anytime)

Your context stays yours.

### Tweet 7 (The Results)
Now:

⏱️ Save 30+ min/week
🧠 Never forget context
🔒 Keep my data private
⚡ Work faster with AI
😌 One less thing to think about

Shipping it publicly because I can't be the only one with this problem.

### Tweet 8 (CTA)

You know the drill:

Your time is worth more than this.

## Tweet Formatting Tips

### Character Counts
- Keep tweets under 280 chars (ideal: 240-270)
- First tweet is most important (hook them!)
- Last tweet needs strong CTA

### Emojis
Use sparingly but effectively:
- 🧵 for thread indicator
- ✅ for features/benefits
- 🔒 for privacy/security
- ⚡ for speed/performance
- 🚀 for launch announcement
- 🔗 for links

### Hashtags
Consider adding to final tweet:
#AI #ChatGPT #Claude #Productivity #OpenSource #Privacy

But don't overdo it (3-5 max)

### Timing
Best times to tweet (EST):
- 9-11 AM (morning work hours)
- 1-3 PM (lunch break browsing)
- 8-10 PM (evening browsing)

Weekdays > Weekends for developer tools

### Engagement Tactics
- Ask question in final tweet
- "RT if..." encourages shares
- "Drop questions below 👇" encourages replies
- Tag relevant accounts (but don't spam)
