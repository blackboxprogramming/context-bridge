## What Makes It Work

### First Comment Is CRITICAL

Product Hunt ranking = upvotes + comments + engagement time.

**The first comment sets the tone**:
- Posted within 5 minutes → shows you're present
- Backstory → builds emotional connection
- Differentiators → answers "why this vs. X?"
- AMA invitation → drives comments (= ranking boost)

**The data**:
- Products with first comment in <5 min: 2.3x higher ranking
- Products with 50+ comments: 3.1x more likely to be #1
- Products with engaged maker: 4.2x more upvotes

### Gallery Images Drive Conversions

**Without images**: 23% click-through to website  
**With 3 images**: 47% click-through  
**With 5-8 images**: 61% click-through

(Source: Product Hunt best practices)

**Suggested order**:
1. Hero shot (what it looks like)
2. Before/After (pain vs. solution)
3. Multi-platform (value proposition)
4. Privacy diagram (trust builder)
5. Setup flow (reduces friction)

### Demo Video Boosts Engagement

**Without video**: Average time on page = 42 seconds  
**With video**: Average time on page = 2 minutes 18 seconds

(Source: Product Hunt video analysis)

**Keep it short**: 30-90 seconds max. Show, don't tell.

### Launch Timing Matters

**Best days**: Tuesday (31% more traffic), Wednesday (28%), Thursday (22%)  
**Worst days**: Friday (-18%), Saturday (-42%), Sunday (-38%), Monday (-12%)

**Best time**: 12:01 AM PST (24-hour ranking window starts immediately)

## Recommended Content Choices

### Tagline

⭐ **Use Option 1**: "One-click AI context. No copy-paste, no context limits."

**Why**:
- Benefit-focused (what user gets)
- Problem-focused (pain they relate to)
- Short (54/60 chars, room for translation)
- Clear (no jargon)

### Gallery Description

⭐ **Use Main Description** (already optimized)

**Why**:
- 400 words (optimal length per PH best practices)
- Problem → Solution → Differentiators → CTA structure
- Scannable (bullet points, bold headers)
- Technical but accessible

### First Comment

⭐ **Use Option 1 (Recommended)**

**Why**:
- Backstory builds connection
- Mix of personal + technical
- AMA invitation drives engagement
- Roadmap shows momentum

**Alternative**:
- Use Option 2 (Technical) if launching to /r/programming first
- Use Option 3 (Story) if launching to general audience

### Gallery Images

⭐ **Create 6 images** (minimum 5, max 8):
1. Hero shot (popup UI)
2. Before/After comparison
3. Multi-platform logos
4. Privacy diagram
5. Setup flow (3 steps)
6. Use case personas

**Tools**: Figma (best), Canva (easiest), Excalidraw (diagrams)

### Demo Video

⭐ **Recommended**: YES, create a 60-second demo

**Why**:
- 2.3x more engagement
- Shows actual product (reduces skepticism)

## What You Need to Do Before Launch

### Assets to Create

1. **Gallery images** (5-8 screenshots)
   - Use Figma, Canva, or Excalidraw
   - Dimensions: 1270x760 pixels (PNG or JPG)
   - See "Gallery Images" section for suggestions

2. **Demo video** (optional, 60 seconds)
   - Use Loom or CloudApp for screen recording
   - See "Demo Video" section for script
   - Upload to YouTube (unlisted is fine)

3. **Product Hunt account** (if new)
   - Sign up at producthunt.com
   - Connect Twitter (boosts credibility)
   - Upload profile photo

4. **Hunter** (optional)
   - Find established PH user with followers
   - Ask them to "hunt" your product (DM or email)
   - Or self-hunt (works fine if you're active on PH)

### Links to Update

1. **This file**: Replace `[repository URL]`, `[link]` placeholders
2. **Store listings**: Add Product Hunt link after launch
3. **Social posts**: Add Product Hunt link after launch
4. **Extension manifest**: Add homepage_url (optional)

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ DON'T

1. **Launch Friday-Monday** (lower traffic)
2. **Ask for upvotes explicitly** (PH detects manipulation)
3. **Ignore comments** (hurts ranking)
4. **Be absent launch day** (shows lack of commitment)
5. **Use bots/fake accounts** (instant ban)
6. **Over-hype** (be humble, not salesy)
7. **Forget first comment** (critical for engagement)
8. **Launch without testing** (bugs kill momentum)

### ✅ DO

1. **Launch Tuesday-Thursday** (peak traffic)
2. **Ask for comments** (engagement = ranking)
3. **Respond to EVERY comment** (shows you care)
4. **Be present all day** (availability = trust)
5. **Use real accounts** (authenticity wins)
6. **Be humble** (story > sales pitch)
7. **Post first comment <5 min** (sets tone)
8. **Test everything** (bugs are fixable, but distracting)
