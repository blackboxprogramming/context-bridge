## Highlight Answers

### Most Important: "What is Context Bridge?"

> Context Bridge is a browser extension that lets you share context with AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Gemini) in one click.
>
> Instead of copy-pasting your tech stack, project details, or coding conventions into every AI conversation, you:
> 1. Store your context in a GitHub Gist (once)
> 2. Click a button in any AI chat
> 3. Your context is inserted automatically

**Why this answer works**:
- One sentence explanation (elevator pitch)
- 3-step workflow (concrete, actionable)
- No jargon (accessible to non-technical users)

### Most Searched: "How is this different from custom instructions?"

**Comparison table**:

| Feature | Context Bridge | Custom Instructions |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Platforms | 4 AI platforms | ChatGPT only |
| Size limit | Unlimited | 1,500 chars |
| Portability | You own it | Locked to OpenAI |
| Versioning | Gist history | No version control |
| Privacy | Open source | Closed source |
| Cost | Free forever | Free (Plus for Pro) |

**Why this works**:
- Visual comparison (table format)
- Feature-by-feature breakdown
- Clear winner in each category
- Ends with recommendations ("Use custom instructions for..., Use Context Bridge for...")

> - ❌ Does NOT collect AI conversations
> - ❌ Does NOT collect GitHub credentials
> - ❌ Does NOT collect usage analytics
> - ❌ Does NOT track you
> - ❌ Does NOT send data to servers (we don't have any!)
