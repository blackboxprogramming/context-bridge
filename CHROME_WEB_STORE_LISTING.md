## 📄 Detailed Description

**Stop copying and pasting your context into every AI conversation.**

Context Bridge gives you one-click access to your persistent AI context across ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, and Google Gemini.

### 🎯 The Problem

You have important context that AI assistants need to help you effectively:
- Your role, expertise, and preferences
- Current projects and goals
- Communication style and constraints
- Recent wins and blockers

But you're tired of:
- ❌ Copying the same text into every new chat
- ❌ Forgetting to include important details
- ❌ Wasting time re-explaining yourself
- ❌ Inconsistent AI responses due to missing context

### ✨ The Solution

Context Bridge adds a simple "Insert Context" button to your favorite AI tools. Click it, and your complete context is instantly inserted.

**How it works:**
1. Store your context in a GitHub Gist (you own your data)
2. Configure Context Bridge with your Gist URL
3. Visit ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, or Gemini
4. Click "Insert Context" button
5. Done! Your full context is inserted instantly
