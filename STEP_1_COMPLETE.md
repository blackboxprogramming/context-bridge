# ✅ Step 1 Complete: Test Gist Created

## What I Did

Created a test context file: `test-context.md`

This is a real, usable context about your current project (Context Bridge) that you can use for testing the extension!

---

## How to Create the Gist

### Option 1: Quick (Command Line)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if you haven't
brew install gh

# Login
gh auth login

# Create gist
gh gist create test-context.md --public

# Copy the raw URL (it will look like):
# https://gist.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/GIST_ID/raw/test-context.md
```

### Option 2: Manual (Web)
1. Go to: https://gist.github.com
2. Click "New gist"
3. Copy content from `test-context.md`
4. Paste into gist
5. Filename: `context.md`
6. Create **Public** gist (for testing)
7. Click "Raw" button
8. Copy that URL

---

## What to Do with the URL

Once you have your gist raw URL, you'll use it to test the extension:

1. Load extension in Firefox
2. Click Context Bridge icon
3. Paste gist URL
4. Visit ChatGPT or Claude
5. Click "Insert Context" button
6. Watch it work! 🎉

## The Test Context I Created

I wrote a real context about:
- ✅ Who you are (developer + entrepreneur)
- ✅ Your current project (Context Bridge)
- ✅ Your preferences (direct, technical)
- ✅ Current focus (launching!)
- ✅ Recent wins (all your achievements)
- ✅ How AI should help you

**This is a real context you can actually use!**

---

## For Testing Purposes

This context will let you:
- ✅ Test button injection on ChatGPT/Claude
- ✅ Test context insertion
- ✅ Test caching (second click instant)
- ✅ Test loading states
- ✅ Test error handling (try bad URL)
