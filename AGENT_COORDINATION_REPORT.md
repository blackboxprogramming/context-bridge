## 💡 Agent Learnings

**What I Discovered**:
1. User already has Stripe live keys (in ~/.stripe_keys)
2. Extension package is pre-built and ready
3. All documentation is exceptionally complete
4. Product is 98% ready - just needs final user actions
5. BlackRoad memory system has 4,059 entries of context

**Potential Issues**:
- NPM publishing requires 2FA (might slow down)
- Stripe products need manual creation (no API automation yet)
- Screenshot quality depends on user's capture skills
- Chrome Web Store review can take 1-3 days (can't control)

**Optimization Ideas**:
- Could automate screenshot capture with Puppeteer
- Could create Stripe products via API in future
- Could set up CI/CD for automatic npm publishing
- Could create video demo alongside screenshots
